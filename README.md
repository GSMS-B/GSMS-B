# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ganasyam Mani Sankar Bugatha!

**Computer Science Student at JNTU-GV CEV** 🎓 | Building at the intersection of **AI** 🤖 and **Finance** 📈

---

I'm passionate about **democratizing institutional-grade investment intelligence for Indian retail investors using cutting-edge AI**.
My mission? Combine artificial intelligence with financial markets—specifically the Indian stock market (NSE/BSE)—to create tools that give everyone an edge.

### 💡 My Philosophy

> "**AI handles the typing, I handle the thinking.**"

I don't write code line by line. I architect solutions and user experiences. AI tools like **Antigravity**, **Anthropic's Claude** and **GitHub Copilot** generate the code, while **Stitch AI** handles the design. This lets me focus on what truly matters: solving problems, building great products, and creating meaningful user experiences.

## 🚀 What I've Built

**ContraSignal** 🎯  
When negative news breaks, stock prices crash. But is it a disaster or a discount? ContraSignal uses a 4-agent AI system (News Sentinel, Fundamental Analyzer with RAG, Peer Comparator, Signal Generator) to answer this in 60 seconds. It detects "divergence"—where bad news meets strong fundamentals—turning market panic into opportunity. Manual analysis takes 4-6 hours. ContraSignal does it in a minute.

**QuantumLeap** ⚛️  
Portfolio optimizer using quantum-inspired QAOA algorithm. Answers two questions: What to buy? (optimal allocation) and When to buy? (market timing with sentiment analysis). Built for Indian stocks, optimizing for Max Sharpe Ratio, Min Variance, or Max Return. Not just optimal portfolios—optimal timing.

**Hush.io** 💬  
Private ephemeral messaging app. No sign-up, no login, no database storage. Messages auto-delete. Complete anonymity. Because privacy isn't a feature—it's a right.

## 📚 Beyond Code

When I'm not building, you'll find me reading books on investing, finance, self-help, and the Bhagavad Gita. I believe timeless wisdom combined with modern technology creates the best solutions. My bookshelf is filled with investment classics and philosophical wisdom—both shape how I think about markets and life.

Currently exploring: **Algorithmic Trading**, **Quantitative Finance**, and how to apply cutting-edge AI techniques to investment strategies.

## 🎯 What's Next

I'm looking to dive deeper into algorithmic and quantitative trading, exploring how AI can revolutionize systematic investment strategies for Indian markets. Building real products that solve real problems—that's what drives me.

**Let's connect if you're interested in AI, finance, or building something impactful together.** 🚀
